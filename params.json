This poses a challenge for many classification and regression algorithms which require complete training sets. We present a new approach for \"repairing\" such incomplete datasets by constructing a sequence of regression models that iteratively replace all missing values. Additionally, our approach uses the target attribute to estimate the values of missing data. The accuracy of our method, Incremental Attribute Regression Imputation, IARI, is compared with the accuracy of several popular and state of the art imputation methods, by applying them to five publicly available benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach.\r\n\r\n# HOW TO USE\r\nTo run the IARI algorithm you need Python 2.7.X, NumPi, Scikit-Learn and a few other python packages installed.\r\nRun the algorithm with the command: \r\n`python runrepair.py datasetname modelname > outputfile.txt`\r\nWhere *datasetname* can be one of:\r\npage, concrete, digits, iris, cover, allhouses\r\nAnd *modelname* can be one of:\r\nGradient, RandomForest, SVM, Gaussian\r\n\r\nThe final results will be outputted in a latex table format.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Results\r\nYou can find all the results of all our experiments together with the experimental setup here:\r\n[Results.pdf](https://github.com/Basvanstein/IARI/blob/master/AlgorithmResults.pdf)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
